# CSCI-80-Intro-to-AI

This is my course project for CSCI-80: Intro to Artifical Intelligence with Python, offered at the Harvard Extension School Fall 2021.
This course is a survey of introductory concepts in artificial intelligence with hands-on project in game development, machine learning, image recognition, and natural language processing. 

Project 0:
* Tic Tac Toe: implement an AI for the game Tic Tac Toe using the minimax algorithm.

Project 1:
* Minesweeper: implement an AI for the game Minesweeper using interference rules.

Project 2:
* PageRank: implement webpage ranking through 2 methods: a Markov Chain random surfer and iterative PageRank formula.

Project 3:
* Crossword: implement an AI to generate a crossword puzzle from a dictionary and a crossword structure, defined as a constraint satisfaction problem. 

Project 4:
* Nim: implement an AI for the game NIM through reinforcement learning. 

Project 5:
* Traffic: implement a neural network to recognize traffic signs in photos, using TensorFlow. 

Project 6:
* Parser: implement an AI to parse a sentence and extract its structure (represented by a syntactic tree) using Python's nltk. 
* Questions: implement an AI to answer queries by parsing a group of documents and ranking text relevence to the query using metrics such as word frequency and inverse document frequency.
